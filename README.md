Hi, Iâ€™m Krish Garg, a sophomore at **Chapman University** majoring in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Data Analytics**. I was born in India and moved to the U.S. at a young age, where I discovered that technology could be a universal language â€” one that empowers, connects, and creates.

My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **healthcare**, and **finance**. From building AI-powered trading bots to personalized learning tools, Iâ€™m passionate about applying research to real-world problems.

As **President of Chapman IEEE**, I focus on building a community where students from all backgrounds can learn, lead, and innovate together.

Iâ€™m a curious builder, always looking for meaningful ways to use AI to tackle complex challenges â€” one line of code at a time.
